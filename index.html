		Mr. Dawood Ali Mattar<br>
		Director of Recruiting and development<br>
		Bahrain Build Construction Company<br>
		P.O Box: 0000<br>
		Manama – Bahrain<br>
		Dear Mr. Dawood<br>
		I read your company’s description in XYZ engineering magazine , and I would like to inquire about
		employment opportunities in your Software engineering department. I want to work in software
		engineering and would like to remain in this field for my graduate education.
		I shall receive my B.Sc. degree in software engineering this September. My interest in engineering
		started in high school when I attended the student introduction to engineering program at
		University of Bahrain. The interest further developed through a variety of construction jobs
		during college. My internship with ABC construction company convince me to pursue this field.
		When I researched the top constructions firms in Bahrain ,” Bahrain Build Construction Company
		“ emerge as having a strong market position, an excellent training program, and a solid
		reputation. In short, you provide the kind of professional environment I seek.
		My resume is enclosed for your consideration, my education and experience match the
		qualifications you seek , but they don’t tell the whole story. I know from supervisor feedback that
		I have the technical and interpersonal skills you seek. My relatively extensive experience gives
		me confidence in my career direction and in my abilities to perform competently.
		I know you must have many demands on your time, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your
		time. I shall call you during the week of October 1st to discuss employment possibilities. In the
		meantime, if you need to contact me everything is given by aside.
		<br><br>
		Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to talking with you.<br>
